# Central Processing Unit Simulator

Central processing unit (CPU) Simulator is the final project of Objected Oriented Programming Course at UTEC.
## Background
Our project allows a real CPU simulation. To achieve our purpose we need to define all parts of CPU and use
a System on chip (SoC) and MIPS architecture.
### CPU COMPONENTS
#### System on Chip
Is a technology of embedded systems, it improves the integration in only one chips, reduces the costs and build
a faster systems.
SoC includes a Hardware block composed by CPU, RM and RWM memories, input and output 
peripherals.
#### Hardware block

This block is subdivided in hardware blocks depending the type of SoC.
To achieve our purposes, we implement a CPU, RAM and ROM memories and Peripherals.
* Central processing unit (CPU): Is the electronic circuitry within a computer that control instructions and my_data flow.
In this project we use a Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS).
* Read memory (RM): It is a memory segment that only allows to read memory by  my_data bus addresses.
* Read write memory (RWM): It is a memory segment that can be read from and written too by my_data bus addresses.
* Peripheral: Is a hardware input or output device, that gives a computer additional functionality, the implement of this
it is a General purpose input/output(GPIO).
* General purpose input/output (GPIO):  Is a digital pin on a integrated circuit controllable by the user at run time,
GPIO is implemented and defined by the designer.
